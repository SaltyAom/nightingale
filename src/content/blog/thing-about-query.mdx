There is this one API design thing that people don't talk about but I think is important.

## How to parse URL query array

Ok let's say you have a URL like this:

```
https://example.com/api?name=a&name=b
```

What should the results be?

If you try the follows in each language/framework, you will get different results:

| Parameter Format    | Node.js      | .Net Core        | PHP               |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| `name=a&name=b`     | `name='b'`   | `name='b'`       | `name='b'`        |
| `name[]=a&name[]=b` | `name[]='b'` | `name[]='b`      | `name=['a', 'b']` |
| `name=a,b`          | `name='a,b'` | `name=['a','b']` | `name='a,b'`      |

<small>
	**Note**: The above table is an example but I didn't recheck, the actual
	result may vary depending on the version of the language/framework but the
	general idea is the same.
</small>

You get a slightly different result in each language/framework.

-   Node.js: If parameter appears multiple time, catch only the last one (no array)
-   .Net Core: If parameter is concat with comma, then parse it as array
-   PHP, Express, Rails: Append square bracket to parameter name to handle it as array

This is because there's no RFC or standard on how should we handle query array, and people have different opinions on how to handle it.

So when people try a difference language/framework, they get confused why the parameter they used to doesn't work *correctly*.

## Elysia use the first appearance only

By default, Elysia will only catch the first appearance of the parameter.

<img src="/blog/thing-about-query/elysia.webp" alt="Elysia handling multiple query parameter by log only the first one by default" class="aspect-3/2" loading="lazy" />

If you want array, you need to explicitly tells Elysia that the specific parameter should be array.

We have tried catching multiple parameter and cast it as array by default but we decided to revert back because.

> It's redundant, annoying, and not convenient to handle the difference between `string`, and `string[]` **every single time**.

Even if you force someone to add a boilerplate to safe guard when people need to do something, they will find a way to not do it or **cheat**.

In our case, people will just cheat by unsafely cast `string | string[]` to `string` and call it a day. Not wanting to deal with the hassle of checking if it's an array or not for a thousand times.

But then, anything that could go wrong will go wrong.

Random people send `name=a&name=b`, and break the system defeating the purpose of having an array in the first place.

## People don't like to admit that they are wrong

Hypothetically speaking.

Once the system is broken, they will complain that the language/framework they're using is bad because it doesn't do what they expected while they are the one who doesn't follow the rules, and cheat in the first place.

If that's the case then I personally think that is from a bad API design decision that allows people to cheat in the first place.

The one who make that design decision is responsible for the action because there is a flaw in API design that will make people cheat in the first place.

I think there's something in Game Design that can be applied to API Design, which is that

## API design is not just about technical implementation, but also understanding how people will use it.

Preventing people from cheating without them knowing is what I think a good API design should have. That's why we don't allow people to cheat in Elysia.

---

## Explicitly say it

If you want to handle query array, you need to explicitly tells Elysia that the specific parameter should be array.

```ts
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
	.get('/', ({ query: { name } }) => name, {
		query: t.Object({
			name: t.Array(t.String())
		})
	})
```

It's the only logical choice for Elysia as this convention is similiar to what we told our user that want to parse a number or boolean from path parameter, and query parameter for years.

```ts
new Elysia()
	.get('/', ({ query: { age } }) => age, {
		query: t.Object({
			age: t.Number()
		})
	})
```

This is the same as how we handle path parameter, query parameter, and body parameter.

## Why first not last?

Following API convention from the giant like Node.js and .Net Core sounds like a good idea but I beg to differ.

There's something called [HTTP Parameter Pollution](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/04-Testing_for_HTTP_Parameter_Pollution) where an attacker can send multiple parameters with the same name to try to exploit the system.

Suppose you have an API endpoint for a marketplace that accept a coupon code via query parameter like:

```
https://api.example.com/buy?refer=saltyaom
```

Then the attacker can exploit the system by append another query parameter after the valid one like this:

```
https://api.example.com/buy?refer=saltyaom&refer=evil
```

So instead of using the first one, the API will use the last one instead.

This can be used to exploit the system by sending a valid coupon code and an invalid one, hoping that the API will use the invalid one instead of the valid one.

Many of the exploits could be done by appending something after the end of the fixed text.

So I just decided to use the first one instead.

And a bit of a performance reason as duplicated key can be skipped, and look ahead saving a few iteration.

However, I don't think there's no right answer for either choosing the first or the last one. I just think that using the first one is more logical for our case.
